# Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

best_friends = ['Wayeth', 'Joshua','Isaac', 'Paul', 'Marc',] # Stores each string into a variable.

greeting = f'Hello {best_friends[0]}, How are you doing?' # Prints the variable as well as their own message corresponding with their element, in this case [0].
print (greeting)

greeting = f'Hey {best_friends[1]}!, What are you cooking?'
print (greeting)

greeting = f'Yo {best_friends[2]}!, What song are you playing?'
print (greeting)

greeting = f'Good morning {best_friends[3]}, How has your day been?'
print (greeting)

greeting = f'Woah {best_friends[4]}, is that what I think it is?'
print (greeting)
