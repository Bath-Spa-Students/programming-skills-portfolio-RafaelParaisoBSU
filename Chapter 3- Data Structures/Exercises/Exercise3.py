# Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

ModesTranspo = ['Yacht', 'Lamborghini', 'Private Jet', 'Helicopter', 'Bugatti',]

msg = f'If I had to choose... I would love a {ModesTranspo[0]} and use it weekly.'
print (msg)

msg = f'If I had to choose... I would love a {ModesTranspo[1]} and use it daily.'
print (msg)

msg = f'If I had to choose... I would love a {ModesTranspo[2]} and use it monthly.'
print (msg)

msg = f'If I had to choose... I would love a {ModesTranspo[3]} and use it yearly.'
print (msg)

msg = f'If I had to choose... I would love a {ModesTranspo[4]} and use it every other day.'
print (msg)
