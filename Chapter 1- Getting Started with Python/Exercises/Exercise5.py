# Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.

radius = float(input("Enter the Radius of the Circle: ")) # Allows a user to input a float value as the radius.
print("The Area of the Circle is" , (3.14*radius*radius)) # Calculates the formula for getting the area which is pi*radius^2
