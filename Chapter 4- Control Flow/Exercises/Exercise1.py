# Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

# •Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

#•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

Alien_Color = 'Dark_Green' # Variable that stores a string.

if Alien_Color == 'Dark_Green': # If statement that prints if the variable is "Dark Green"
        print ("Wow! You just won 5 points!") 

Alien_Color = 'Bright_Pink'

if Alien_Color == 'Dark_Green': # If statement that prints if the variable is "Dark Green"v
        print ("Wow! You just won 5 points!")
